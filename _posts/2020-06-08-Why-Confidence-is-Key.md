  Countless studies prove it. Millions of teachers and parents believe it. Most students know it. Confidence creates 
a better school life for students. However, almost all high school students suffer from insecurities. It's only natural. 
High school has always created a highly competitive and generally toxic environment. Students always want to get the highest
grade in the class or do better than their friends. They want to please their parents with grades or just feel happy with
themselves. And that's just academicly speaking. There's always that thought in the back of your head asking youself how you
look or whos attention you might grab. Do I look good enough that someone might even ask me out or do I look like a try-hard?
Even if you want to just not care about your looks or you go to school in pajamas, the thought's still there. Most of us
pretend like it isn't too. We don't want attention on us but we still want compliments and to be noticed. We automatically
compare ourselves to those around us all the time and it only hurts more. Sometimes we just need to cover up that hurt, but it's
notlike we can tell anyone how we feel. So maybe we'll make fun of others or we'll bully them whether to their face or behind 
back. We bottle up our emotions so we don't have to address them. Then, as though that isn't bad enough, social media multiplies
that by 100000%. For example, instagram. The whole point of the app is just to show off your life and make people jealous. You
post pictures you think you look best in so when people see it they think about you because what's the point besides getting in
people's heads for indirect attention. All we do on social media is look at other people or look for validation in ourselves.
Some people won't admit it. They'll say they post on social media for the fun of it but everyone feels a little better after
getting tons of likes or comments, showing people's approval. Showing that people approve of you. All of that. How could we not
be insecure. Sometimes you need someone to remind you of everything that makes you great. You need advice without being judged 
made fun of by your close friends, because you trust them, but don't always feel good around them. Studies show that increased
confidence helps students do better in school and be more outgoing.

students who had high self-confidence are proven to:
* have much higher test scores
* be more outgoing and readily jump into new activities
* be more optimistic and generally happy
