In the last three weeks my19-year-old daughter has moved in with her boyfriend and his parents. It started with her sleeping over there, then one night and I told her that I do not like or want her doing this, and the nights increased to three nights a week. I keep telling her I am not happy with this. Instead of changing, now she has been staying there for three weeks. We talk everyday, I keep telling her I love her and want her home. She has been home for one night and brief visits. I have repeatedly spoken to the boy's parents and it seems they are encouraging this. My heart is breaking daily. What can I do?

Dear Jazzy,
</span><p>
Since your daughter is an adult, you have limited say over her decisions. However, if your daughter's boyfriend is not treating her with respect or making unhealthy decisions, then you may have to intervene in a more forceful way. If that is not the case, the best advice I can give you is to make sure you keep talking to her. But don't keep reminding her that you want her home. Instead, tell her how much you appreciate the phone calls and the short visits home. When she does visit, no matter how brief that is, let her know that you're very happy to see her and try to plan a fun activity with her. Your daughter may need to be reminded about the positive aspects of a loving mother-daughter relationship. Basically, I'm suggesting that you cut down on the nagging, no matter how upset you are, and increase your acceptance of her choices.

Dear Worried Mom,
</span><p>
It is important to keep your good relationship with your daughter, but I can't imagine staying silent about the information you just learned. Before you initiate a conversation with her, make sure that what you heard is accurate. If it is, the key is treating her with respect when you discuss this, and listen to her side of the story. Don't tell her you're shocked, instead calmly express your concern. You might also encourage her to take a refresher defensive driving course online, which could help her insurance rates and remind her of the importance of not driving while using alcohol or drugs—both for her welfare and others on the road.

My 20-year-old daughter is highly intelligent, very dyslexic, and has very low self-confidence. After starting college she began a short lived relationship with an emotionally abusive boy. When it ended she was distraught to the point of contemplating suicide. Now she has been seeing another boy, whom she met a while ago. He is charming, kind, and enjoys much of the same things she does. But he does drugs. What should I do?

Dear Belle,
</span><p>
When you say that "he does drugs," what do you mean? Is it marijuana once in a while? Or are you referring to using hard drugs frequently? Your answer to those questions will help you determine whether this new boyfriend is a good influence or not. Regardless of his drug use, since your daughter was so upset by her experience with an emotionally abusive boy that she thought of suicide, you need to encourage her to seek psychotherapy. Since you mentioned that she has "very low self-confidence," therapy could help her to deal with future relationship issues as well as personal challenges.

My tenth grade daughter has begun hanging out with a friend who looks and acts as if she were eighteen. She spends most of her time with boys who are two or three years older than her, smoking cigarettes. While my daughter respects the curfew we've imposed on her, any time I touch the topic of her friend she becomes extremely angry and defensive, but it's hard for me to stand by and say nothing. What do you think?

Dear Worried Dad,

You're the parent, and it's your job to continue to do your best to keep your daughter safe. So, continue to talk to her about values and expectations, even though she may not want to hear them. But be aware of your tone of voice, and keep your conversations casual (not heated) and clear. You don't want to force your daughter to choose between you and her friends—you might lose. Try to recognize and understand what your daughter finds attractive in this new friend, while simultaneously helping her to be open to other friends who may be better influences.

I'm a 42-year-old empty nester with two adult sons. I moved out of state and am living with my boyfriend as of three months. Since then, I've been trying to build a relationship with his 17-year-old daughter. Things with her have been very hard and not what I expected. She cries continually and is disrespectful. She resents her father for moving during her junior year in high school and desperately wants to move back. She asked me recently to help her and report her father for child abuse. I haven't noticed abuse since living here, but I don't disbelieve her either from some signs. Please help. What do I do?

<div class="ans Drb"><span class="b">
	Dear Wendy,
 </span><p>
There are two serious questions you raise. One is your relationship with your boyfriend's daughter, and the other is her relationship with her father. 
</p><p> 
It is quite traumatic for a teenager to move to a new high school as a junior. She is the "new kid in town" and an outsider at a time when she would much prefer to be with the friends she has known. It is not at all surprising she would feel uprooted, lonely, and sad. Add to those feelings having a new adult living with her combined with normal teenage hormones, and you can see why the result might be disrespectful behavior. Because she is young, she has not yet figured out a healthier way to react to you. It sounds like you are not trying to act like a mother to her (which would make her even more resentful), so that is a good start. Keep trying to talk with her calmly to let her know you understand how hard it is to move as a junior in high school while making the point that disrespect is not the answer.  
</p><p> 
However, I want to emphasize that I am much more concerned with her requesting your help to report her father for child abuse. That is a grave accusation, particularly since you said, "... but I don't disbelieve her either from some signs." I think you both need to talk to someone at her school right away about the best way to handle this. If she is saying this so that she has an excuse to move back to where her friends are, a trained professional would be able to figure this out. But if there is actual abuse, then she does need to be removed from his home, and you must also consider whether this is a man with whom you want to live. 
</p><p> 
I hope you can act as soon as possible to get to the truth. Either way, his daughter needs help from a trained, objective therapist to deal with all the emotions she is experiencing. If you are in a "stay at home" situation due to the coronavirus, that makes this more complicated. But it still a necessary move.

Recently my 16-year-old kid got caught cheating in sports. He was disqualified and banned from the game. I understood that he did it because of the pressure of winning and expectations. We had a long talk, and he was sorry for his wrongdoing. However, I worry about what is going to happen. I worry about his reputation and all the teasing and criticism that he is going to receive. It bothers me that people are going to look at him and think he is a bad kid. Because he is not a bad kid, he is just a kid who made a wrong decision under pressure. I wish there is a way to make other parents understand that my kid is not bad. I know my kid did a bad thing, but how can I make everything better?

Dear Vicky,
</span><p>
You can't make everything better. Your son got into trouble because he cheated. You understand why he did what he did. But sometimes, the way teens learn best is by dealing with the consequences of their "bad" behavior. He will have to earn back the trust of his teammates, his coach, and the community. While you shouldn't excuse his behavior, you can brainstorm with him ways he can get others to change their view of him. For example, he could publicly apologize, organize a fund-raiser for a community event, or volunteer at an animal shelter. You can also help your son by asking him to think about how he wants to respond when he gets teased. Hopefully, your son has learned a valuable lesson that will serve him well in the future.

For about a month, my 17-year-old daughter has been dating a 15-year-old. He has been over to meet my
husband and me. He is a good kid as far as we can tell, but we still don't
know him or his family well. My daughter recently asked to go over to his house
after school and assured me that his mother would be there. We have made it
very clear that they would not be allowed to be home alone at either of our
homes, but I'm not sure if his family has the same rules. We were hoping to get
the phone number of his mother to double-check that the same rules are in place
at his home, but my daughter is very stubborn about this. She says that it is not my
place to get involved in their relationship, and since she has never done
anything to lose our trust, she should be allowed to go over his house without
me contacting the mother first. Is it unreasonable for me to ask for his
mother's phone number? Or should we trust that my daughter is responsible and
will not do anything to disobey our rules?

<div class="ans Drb"><span class="b">
Dear Dee,
</span><p> 
It is certainly reasonable to ask for the phone number of
the mother of your daughter's new boyfriend for assurance that his family has
the same rules as you do. Even with a 17-year-old daughter you trust, she is still a teenager dating someone two years younger. And boys' emotional
development often lags behind that of girls so he may act in immature ways when
they are alone together.
</p><p> 
It is not surprising your daughter wants to exert her
independence at her age. She also feels she has earned your trust. If you agree
she has earned your trust, do you think you would jeopardize your relationship
by insisting on speaking to the mother? And if she still refuses to give you
the mother's phone number, will you forbid her from going to his house to
study? What if she says they will go to the library instead? Will you track her
phone or check up on her? What if you do talk to the boy's mother and she
doesn't have a problem with her son and his girlfriend being alone in their
house? You could be embarking on a slippery slope.
</p><p> 
You might take a different approach with your
daughter—talk with her about your concerns (including about the boy's
age) and listen to what she has to say. Keep in mind that you don't want to
force your daughter into lying to you or destroy the relationship you have with
her. Most importantly, do everything you can to keep the lines of communication
open between the two of you.

My 19-year-old son, who was always a terrific kid, had lots of friends and did well in school, started dating a girl he met at work last year. Since he has started dating her, he has changed in ways I would never have imagined.  My son and I had a very close relationship, and now that I have tried to help bring things to light, he has rebelled against me. My son is on academic probation at college. He has control/obsession issues with his girlfriend (I know this from reading text messages between them), he doesn't associate with any of his friends, he doesn't want to be a part of the family. He said he hates me, hates living with me, etc. I have his car in my name, loan in my name, and car insurance in my name, and he has had three accidents. I have asked him to please get a loan to pay the car off so I can get the car out of my name as it is too big of liability risk for me. Since I get up early in the morning to go to work and have extended hours, I have asked my son to be home by 11 during the week and by one on weekends, and he thinks that is being unreasonable. His dad and I divorced in 2009, and his dad was not a part of his life from 2010 until two months ago.  His dad told him if he moves in with him, he can do whatever he wants, go wherever he wants, no questions asked. His parents are going to pay off his car and put it in their names so that he can keep the vehicle. My concern is now that he is with his dad; he doesn't want to maintain any relationship with me or his 18-year-old brother. I text him every day to tell him I love him and want what is best for him, and all he will say is thanks and ends the conversation. His dad lives at home at almost 50 and is very irresponsible with money, filed bankruptcy, and still requires his parents to help support him financially, has anger issues, and has walked out of two jobs because he doesn't want to follow the rules. 
I am afraid that they will also make my son dependent upon them now that they are willing to pay everything for him. I hope you can offer some advice on how I should handle the situation.

Dear Concerned Mom,
</span><p>
Your son is an adult, and he has the right to make his own decisions and his own mistakes. That doesn't mean you should not give your son advice or express your concerns, but recognize that when you do, he will probably ignore you or make disparaging comments about your suggestions. One approach worth trying is talking to your son's grandparents, giving them your perspective on the situation you're all in. They should understand the responsibility they're taking on when they put the car in their name and pay all his expenses.
 </p><p>
At the same time, try to understand why your son is deciding to live with his dad and grandparents—they are letting him do whatever he wants with no cost to him. It's a temptation that would be very hard to resist for any young person. However, you still have a job to do, and that means you need to stay in contact with your son as much as you can. Perhaps you can ask him to join you for a short coffee/tea break and promise not to bring up his living situation (and if he agrees, be sure to keep your promise). Keep in mind that the point of spending time with your son is to lessen the negativity and hard feelings between the two of you. Be patient as you regain your relationship with your son. It's good that you text your son to tell him you love him; now it's about showing him how much you love him by treating him like the adult he is.

About four months ago, my daughter (then 17) moved in with her boyfriend and his parents. I hardly ever see her even though we talk (briefly) on her phone at work. As a child, she was always headstrong, knew what she wanted career-wise with her life, and was so independent. Now she only wants to be with him. She has no cell phone (she let hers get disconnected). He doesn't have one, and his mother doesn't answer hers half the time. They're Asian (not that I'm racist), but they're not too bright, and she thinks his family is great. She says I'm jealous. I'm not. I want our close loving relationship back. I've tried to tell her not to settle down yet, to get a car and get her career moving first—to live life while she's young. I cry every night, and I'm so hurt. Will she get her head out of the clouds and come back? I need advice. I'm so sad and hurt. Please help.

Dear Cindy,
</span><p>
I wonder about a couple of things in your letter: why your daughter moved in with her boyfriend's family when she was just 17, and why you mentioned that they are Asian when that doesn't seem to be a relevant factor. It seems to me that there were issues between you and daughter before she left home, and you may need to think about the underlying reasons for the first rift. You are obviously and understandingly very upset about the change in the relationship with your daughter, and to repair it consider not focusing right now about how you think she should live her life (getting a car, pursuing a career, etc.). If you go in with the attitude that her head is "in the clouds" instead of listening to her concerns, you won't be taking a step in the right direction. Instead your priority should be on restoring the loving relationship you once had with her. Start by inviting her to share a meal with you, preferably at a neutral location. Since your daughter thinks her boyfriend's family is great, try to find out what she likes about them. Look for opportunities to get to know them better. And be patient since it has probably taken a long time to get to the situation you're in now, so it's bound to take a while to mend it.

Dear Alice,
</span><p>
While your teenage son probably thinks he's old enough to set all the rules for his computer and phone use, his judgment is perhaps not as good as he thinks it is. That's where you come in. Take time with your son to brainstorm a logical plan that includes his use of the internet as well as how much screen time he uses on a daily or weekly basis. Let him know that you trust his judgment, but that as his parent, you play a crucial role in guiding him to make healthy and safe choices. For instance, occasionally walk by your son when he's on the computer and casually ask what he's exploring. If he's sacrificing sleep time for screen time, talk with him about time management strategies and the relationship between enough sleep and school performance. Be sure to have conversations with your son about internet safety issues, perhaps using relevant recent news items as examples. Keep in mind that in a couple of years, your son will probably be leaving home, and one of your responsibilities is to prepare him for independence. That's why helping him establish good habits now will go a long way toward reliable decision-making in the future.

 My 16-year-old son has recently been dating a 13-year-old girl. At first, he told me she was 14. Shortly after, I found out she was 13, and I expressed my concerns to him that she is far too young. I hadn't met her yet, but she blocked me from all social media. His behavior has changed. He spends a lot of his time in his room, on his phone, etc. I understand that this can be typical in most new relationships. I have since caught him in a lie/scheme to see her, which included them spending time at a friend's house. I try to keep him as busy as possible. He has lost his phone privileges for some time, and I have since given him a curfew. Recently I have found out that she smokes cigarettes and pot. I also believe she is somewhat sexually active, and to my knowledge, my son is not. I have tried to speak to my son about drug abuse with little to no response. Her father knows of the relationship and the age difference, and my son tells me that her father is not concerned. I am at a loss. Do I contact her father? Do I set further limitations on time spent with her? I am trying to be very careful as the more I push, the more he will want to see her. HELP!

Dear Confused Mom,
</span><p>
You mention a couple of very different concerns. One is that your son's girlfriend is too young for him, while the other seems to be that she might be a bad influence on him. 
</p><p>
On the age point, you are rightly concerned, especially if they are, in fact, sexually active. Many states have so-called "Romeo and Juliet" laws, which specify the acceptable age difference between two minor sexual partners for the one who has reached the age of consent to avoid liability for statutory rape. In some states, the age of consent is 16, and the acceptable age difference is only two years. So if your 16-year-old son is in a sexual relationship with his 13-year old girlfriend, that could be legally problematic depending on where you live. (This is not intended as and should not be considered legal advice. See the note on our homepage (http://askdrm.org/), for more information.)
</p><p>
Legal concerns aside, there is a reason why there is no safe harbor for sexual relationships involving 16 and 13-year olds in some places: the difference in emotional, mental, and physical maturity between a 16-year-old and a 13-year-old can be very significant. That may be the case here, or it may not. Still, if you think that the maturity difference is substantial enough that the relationship is inappropriate, then you have a responsibility to take action. You could put a stop to the relationship, or otherwise take steps to prevent it from continuing, which may include contacting the girl's father and mother or other guardians. While her father is fine with it, that doesn't necessarily mean that others responsible for her wellbeing are on-board.
</p><p>
As for your other concern, that this girl may be a bad influence—assuming that the relationship is not inappropriate, then you may want to tread more carefully.  Implementing punishments or taking other actions—like just trying to keep him busy, without tying them to particular infractions—sends a confusing message to your son that he is subject to punishment and adverse treatment irrespective of whether he obeys your rules.  Assuming again for the sake of argument, that the relationship is not inappropriate, then it's perfectly normal for him to want to see her. If your rules prevent him from doing that, he will try to get around them, and you should expect as much. Consider well whether or not what you are forbidding is reasonable. Educate your son about the risks of drugs and being sexually active and set consistent rules and consequences regarding such activities. If you think the relationship is inappropriate, then you should end it outright. But if not, then trying to put an end to it indirectly with excessive or arbitrary prohibitions and punishments will likely just result in broken rules and broken trust.

Dear Alynah,
</span><p>
Your daughter tried talking with you, but you weren't ready to accept her feelings. Now she has shown you in a very direct way that she is depressed and has found a way to deal with those emotions. Here's some information that may help you: Depression can take many forms in addition to sadness and crying. Some people use cutting to relieve their pain, others act out in aggressive ways. Your daughter evidently worked hard to disguise what she was feeling, and then when you denied her feelings, she became angry, but the underlying emotions of sadness did not go away. What is essential at this point is to support your daughter as she gets help to deal with her depression. Seek out a counselor who works with adolescents with issues similar to your daughter's, and let your daughter know that you made a mistake when you didn't listen to what she was telling you. It's not too late to change the situation around and become more of an advocate for your child.

Hello, My question concerns my 25-year-old daughter, who is dating a guy. She is a college graduate with a four-year degree and a good job. She started to date a guy who graduated from high school and has a good job but did not attend college. She then broke it off because, in a fit of temper and jealousy, he punched her car windshield and shattered it. He has a reputation as a hothead and a 'jerk' (heard from others). My daughter lived in the city on her own for a year and told us she was not associated with him anymore. Having moved back home, she is involved again with him. We are concerned about indications of violence and jealousy. She tells us we need to trust her judgment and that she can figure it out. I am having a hard time accepting her choices. How do I come around?

Your daughter is 25. That means that she will make her own choices. It doesn't mean that they'll be the right ones or that you can't give your opinion, but it does mean that at the end of the day, they're hers to make. That said, it's essential to keep an open line of communication with your daughter—if she does need help at some point, you want her to know that she can come to you. Indeed, don't take any indications of abuse or physical violence lightly. You can report anything you observe firsthand to the police, and you can report domestic violence you don't observe firsthand, by asking the police to make a welfare check. You can find more resources here on what you can do if you know or suspect that your daughter is being abused at <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/get-help/how-help-friend" target="_blank">The Office on Women's Health</a> of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

My 19-year-old daughter is a sophomore in college. She has been dating a 31-year-old man—12 years older. They met at the local gym while she was a senior in high school. He started as a creepy guy at the gym, and it evolved into a secret affair the summer before college. On her very first weekend in college, she went "no contact" for two days as he had driven across the state to her college and took her camping in the mountains. It was then that her dad and I became aware that he had become more than the gym creep. When we met, he made a poor first impression, and he has done nothing to show us that he honors our daughter or respects our role in her life. Fast forward a year, she is now living at home, transferred schools, is taking all online courses at a local university, works during the day at a restaurant, and spends every evening with him. She's pleasant enough at home but has no genuine interaction with her family. I try to be neutral about her relationship, but she knows we aren't crazy about him. Frankly, I think he's an opportunist and has taken advantage of her gullibility and robbed her of her youth. He has a job but lives with his parents, so that's where she spends most of her time.
</p><p>
I know she's an adult and in charge of her own decisions, good or bad. It's just so hard to sit still when I have so much disdain toward him, and as a result, she's unable to share that part of her life with me. She knows I'm supportive in other areas of her life, and we get along great that way.
</p><p>
How do I get past my disapproval of him when I see so many flaws in his character? We tried taking baby steps to get to know him. We had him over for family game night last winter and thought it went well. He informed me later that we should have made a bigger fuss over him. He also said some distasteful things that I could never imagine my husband saying to my mother or any man telling a potential mother-in-law. I appreciate any advice.

Dear Penny,

You're in a pretty tough situation. You want to maintain your relationship with your daughter while also trying to look out for her best interests. You must feel very frustrated seeing your relationship with your daughter change. There are several things you are doing right: 1, recognizing that your daughter is an adult and in charge of her decision-making. 2, making an effort to get to know her boyfriend, and 3, maintaining a supportive relationship in areas of your daughter's life outside of her romantic choice. While you don't know what the future will bring, you should prepare yourself for the possibility that this man will be in your daughter's life for a long time to come. Keeping that in mind, think of other actions you can take to change the dynamics of the relationship between you and the boyfriend. Although he wasn't happy about the degree of fuss you made over him last winter, the new season brings fresh opportunities to invite him over for dinner and another game night. If your daughter mentions that he doesn't like how you've treated him, remind her that you're doing your part to reach out in positive ways. 
</p><p>
One more thing to keep in mind: While it's essential to treat your daughter's choices as hers to make, you should step in if there is ever a time when her boyfriend becomes abusive.

My 16-year-old daughter was an honor student, great grades, happy, and playful with her younger sibling until junior year when her grades started dropping. I would ask her why. Do you need help (tutoring)? How can I help? But she never said anything, and she became more rude with her younger sister. She stayed isolated in her room with just her cell phone, the door closed, and earbuds on. Even my youngest daughter noticed her bad attitude and how rude she was with us. One day I got upset because I always told her to put her cell phone away while doing homework, and she refused, so I took the phone away. She looked at me with a scared look, and to my surprise, she was texting with her boyfriend. I confronted her. At first, I got upset and told her she was too young to have a boyfriend. I told her that this is why her grades are dropping. She, of course, denied it. I told her I was going to tell her father, and I did. He got upset and demanded that she break up with the boyfriend and concentrate on school. I agreed with him. I know she cries because she doesn't want to break up with him. I, on the other hand, am very hurt because she did not have the confidence in me to tell me about the relationship. She lied when I asked her if she had a boyfriend. What should I do since I don't think that at 16, she should even be going through this? And maybe the boyfriend thing would not have been much of a problem (although I don't agree) if she didn't start getting low grades and having a bad attitude. Should I support her with him (they've only been dating for one month)? My husband also told her we were going to move her to a new school. I also feel guilty because I used to be there for my daughters all the time until I found a full-time job two years ago to help out with the bills. But, I think this is biting me in the butt. I feel like quitting my job. I try to be a sweet mom. I tell my girls I love them, I hug them, and we strive to give them what is within our means but, I also tell them that just because I love them doesn't mean I will agree with everything they do, and I will always reprimand them if I feel they're not right. Yet, I feel like all this has been in vain because my daughter didn't trust me enough even to tell me she had a boyfriend. Ever since this happened a few days ago, she barely speaks to us. I talk to her, and she answers very coldly, she doesn't smile, clearly she's upset. What should we do? Please! I need your advice.

Dear Jessie,
</span><p>
I do not know what your religious beliefs are, but from my experience as a mother of three grown children and 40 years of working with parents and their children, I do not think that having a boyfriend at 16 is unusual. It's probably a vital part of growing up. Of course, if the boyfriend is much older than she is, and a loser, that's a different story. I think you and your husband overreacted about this, and with that kind of reaction, I suspect it would be difficult for her to confide in you. That said, a natural part of adolescence is keeping one's parents "out" and becoming independent. One has to learn to "agree to disagree" with one's teenagers.
</p><p>
Something is going on with your daughter, but the slipping grades are not because she has a boyfriend. Moreover, I don't recommend quitting your job to solve the problem. I do suggest turning the volume way down low regarding her boyfriend. Do you know anything about him? Don't you want to know? For all you know, he could be a good influence. Often, a relationship can work to help a person grow. Maybe invite him to dinner, and start getting to know him. 
</p><p>
The deteriorating grades are significant—consider them as an independent issue. Is your daughter upset about them? There is a lot of pressure in junior year, especially if she is college-bound. I wonder if she is depressed or having a lot of anxiety.  Maybe she could talk to a guidance counselor about her grades. Or you could all speak to a family therapist. 
</p><p>
Try to remember your 16-year-old self, and what was going on in your life, which might help you relate to your daughter's situation.

My boyfriend's son, who is almost 19, is such a baby. Still, at his age, you have to tell him to comb his hair, brush his teeth, and even wash his hands, especially after going to the bathroom. He still makes deliberate forced loud farting and belching sounds not only at home but out in public at restaurants, etc. He even announces at the table in restaurants: "I have to go drop a load," in a booming voice. When his Dad tells him not to do it, he laughs. If you ask him whether he has brushed his teeth or washed his hands, he lies with us catching him by watching and seeing his toothbrush not moved and dry, etc. He lies constantly. He cheated his way through school and barely graduated. He is only concerned with playing video games, watching tv and playing on his phone with his door shut. If you ask him to help with something, he pretends to be asleep until the job is done so that he won't have to help. 
</p><p>
His mom and Dad divorced when he was 2. Mom got custody, with Dad getting every other weekend and holidays. He tried to teach and correct the best he could with Mom undoing when she got the kids back. Dad was also afraid she would not let him see his kids if he did too much correcting. There are three kids, two older girls, who are the same way but not quite as bad. How can we make him grow up, take on personal responsibility, manners, morals, etc.?

Dear Pulling Hair Out,
</span><p>
First of all, know that it's not your responsibility to correct your boyfriend's son, and there are limits to how much you can do to help him grow up. However, the son is an adult, and losing custody is no longer an issue. Your boyfriend can take more action now to influence his son's behavior. For example, your boyfriend might indicate that he is not interested in going out to restaurants with his son if he continues to make inappropriate noises or comments. Naturally, your boyfriend will have to be sensitive and aware of how hard he can push in terms in terms of punishments or consequences to see what's working and what could damage the relationship. 
</p><p>
There is a way that you can support your boyfriend in his efforts to help his son grow up, which is by positively reinforcing his behavior when he acts like a mature adult. For example, if he does help you with something, even if it's after a lot of nagging or an ultimatum from his father, make sure to tell him that you really appreciate his help. You and your boyfriend can also help by treating the son like an adult, which he is.

Dear Lola,
</span><p>
You started by saying your daughter is 18, which means she's an adult. So even though she's still your daughter, she's also grown now and has to make mistakes for herself and fight her own battles. That doesn't mean you can't have an opinion about what she does or that you can't or shouldn't talk to her about it. But it's not your place to go around her and try to solve her problems for her, especially when it sounds like she doesn't perceive there to be a problem (at least currently). You have more knowledge and experience than she does, and you could give her the benefit of that, but it's up to her to decide whether she wants it. If you're going to repair your relationship with your daughter, one way to start might be by apologizing to her for going straight to the boyfriend with your objections, not only explaining your concerns but also how you'll deal with such issues in the future. Try asking for her input to make it a collaborative effort to rebuild your relationship. So hopefully, you can both agree on the best way to communicate going forward in a way that strengthens and maintains the trust between you.

Dear Alycia,
</span><p>
At your son's age, a new boyfriend in your life could feel threatening. Your son may be concerned that you will have less time to spend with him or that you will care less about him now that another man is in the picture. You didn't say anything about how your son reacted to other romantic relationships you may have had. You need to find out why your son is acting the way he is and identifying the underlying issues. Is there anything this man did to elicit your son's negative reaction, or is your son merely reacting to the fact that you're in a relationship? It's time to have a frank discussion with your son. Be sure to accept whatever he says with a calm demeanor and listen to his point of view. And you also might need to remind your son that rude behavior is not acceptable in your family.

My 17-year-old daughter has a severe anxiety disorder and PTSD, so as horrible as it sounds, it's not unusual for her to be on edge, worried, etc. However, over the past few months, one specific fear that she has has been manifesting has been getting worse. She has frequent nightmares about her teeth rotting and falling out. She wakes up crying and feeling around her mouth. With her permission, I talked with her therapist and he indicated that this fear had been an issue for years. He believes it is related to a particular phobia or the severe bullying she has endured for being "ugly." I'm at a loss. Everywhere she goes, she carries a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss. She also seems obsessed with going to the dentist. She's like a kid on Christmas every time she gets her teeth cleaned. The last time we went, her dentist pulled me aside and told me that he was concerned because she was rambling to him about a spot on one of her teeth. When he looked, there was nothing there, but she was insisting that it looked horrible and that she was scared that her tooth was rotting. What do you think I should do?

Dear Ruth,
</span><p>
Your daughter is suffering, and on the surface, it sounds like an obsessive-compulsive disorder symptom. I am concerned that it may develop into something more serious. Is there a local center where she can get a psychiatric/psychological evaluation? It seems that once-a-week therapy may not be enough to get her through this time. Is she entering her senior year?  I suspect she is not only feeling anxious but depressed as well. She may be feeling that something is rotting, and concern for her teeth are a way of expressing this.   
</p><p>
Medication could be helpful with the symptoms your daughter is exhibiting, but you need a proper clinical diagnosis to clarify if medicine could help. Also, if her current therapist is not adequate for your daughter, you might want to find a therapist who has had successful experience dealing with adolescents who have experienced similar issues.

My 17-year-old daughter is pressuring me to allow her to go camping with her 17-year-old boyfriend, who has just gotten a truck. I say, "No way," and she argues back: "How can I prepare myself for adulthood if I am never given the opportunity to experience things to prepare me for adulthood?" She has been sexually active in the past (during times she was supposed to be at school), and since then I have been diligent about maintaining an atmosphere of as much supervision as I possibly could, being a single working mom. No night-overs anywhere, setting up an area at home for her friends to come over and veg, watch TV, play games, etc., No going to anyone's house unless I talk to parents, make sure there will be supervision (so far I have had zero conversations with any parents!). She has struggled in the past with social anxieties, depression, impulsive behaviors, and poor choices. She is in credit recovery due to being way behind in school credits, seems to believe getting a C in a class is "ok, at least I am not failing!" She is strong-willed, persistent, and argumentative when she has not gotten her way in something. After she turned 13, it became increasingly challenging to keep her in alignment with family values and restrictions. In the past, she has lied and stolen from members of the family, including me. But she says, "I am not like that anymore." And her attitude, after all, has been, "My friend's parents aren't as strict as you are!"  
</p><p>
She has been earning back trust for about 8-10 months now. She's been doing well with following restrictions, boundaries, etc., but feels she should be able to make decisions and have a say in whether she's allowed to do things like going camping with her boyfriend so she is better prepared for adulthood when she turns 18. I hesitate to bring up her past because she tends to spiral downhill whenever I do. She believes those actions and choices are in the past, and that she should not be judged based on them since she has moved forward and is a new person now. So far, I have been able to hold the line of control and kept her accountable for her choices, deeds, and actions. I've also told her she is not yet 18 and camping overnight with a boyfriend, unsupervised is inappropriate for a 17-year-old. And I've explained that even when she is 18, she will still be expected to adhere to boundaries if she is 100% dependent on me financially for home, food, etc. She is struggling with these concepts as she thinks that 18 is the magic age of total freedom to do as she wants, come and go as she pleases, no more answering to a parent, etc. What are your thoughts?

Dear Mrs. G,
</span><p>
You're in a difficult situation, but try to remember that your daughter seems to have matured. From what you described, she seems to have dropped many of the rebellious behaviors that were part of her past, but it's tough to forget about all the wrong decisions she made when she was a young teen. I understand that you're afraid that if you let go of the restrictions that have become part of your household rules, she will spiral back to where she had been. Let her know about your concerns and work with her to find compromises. If you don't know her boyfriend well, get to know him. You might find that he's a good influence on her. And, if he's not, you can explain why you don't want them to go camping alone. Perhaps they can put together a group camping trip. Another action you can take is to get to know the parents of her other friends. As a group, you will have more influence than one parent alone, and you can look out for their kids while they're looking out for your daughter.
</p><p>
You didn't mention whether she is planning to go to college or get a job after she finishes high school. But she's certainly at the stage when she needs to prepare for independent living. You can help her by gradually loosening the reins and allowing her to take responsibility, at least in part, for the decisions that affect her the most. She will undoubtedly make some mistakes, but that's part of growing up. And you should be there to support her.&nbsp;

This is a follow up to my question earlier this month regarding my 17-year-old daughter. Since she graduated from high school, she has been spending every waking moment away from home with her friends. She leaves for college this fall (which we will be paying for). In my earlier question, I explained how sad I was that we were not seeing her in the limited time she had left living at home. She was angry and resentful of any attempts to enforce curfews or asking her to spend time with us. The day after she turned 18, we had a big argument, and she said she could no longer live with all our rules, and that would be moving out to live with her friend's family. I was so shocked, angry, and devastated that I told her that she was ungrateful and if she felt that way, she should get out. I called her bluff—but she was not bluffing.
</p><p>
She has been gone for eight days now. She has texted my husband when she has needed things from the house but refuses to speak with him on the phone or in-person. She won't tell us where she is staying except to say that she is safe and needs time. I sent her an email apologizing for losing my temper with her. She said thank you, but she needs time away from us. 
</p><p>
We do not know her friends nor their parents but have their addresses. We are giving her time and not contacting her for now. I know that she is enjoying herself and partying with her friends 24/7 and has no incentive to reconcile with us until her friends leave for college in a month. My husband and I have an excruciating sense of loss, like the five stages of grief. I was trying to prepare emotionally for having her leave for college in the fall and was hoping to spend a little time with her before she left. Instead, she callously left so she can spend the summer partying with her friends with no thought whatsoever to the fact she has broken my heart. She was raised in a loving, supportive home, no abuse, no substance abuse issues. We have provided everything for her and feel so betrayed and rejected. I know she needs to assert her independence, but she is leaving in two months and will be completely independent then.
</p><p>
How do we deal with the pain and increasing resentment caused by this unexpected separation? Do we continue to leave her alone until she reaches out to us after her friends leave? Do we reach out to her friends' parents to see what is going on even though she would resent that? Do we let her move back home during the month after her friends leave for college before she goes? I am worried that if she moves back in, things will be worse because of mutual resentments. Although she just turned 18, she is still a child emotionally and is not willing or able to see anything but her needs.

Dear Sadie,
</span><p>
I'm so sorry to hear that your relationship with your daughter has gone downhill since you last wrote to us. Without fully understanding your daughter's point of view, it's difficult to know how to answer some of your questions. The most important thing right now is to have an open dialogue with your daughter, both about what happened and to try to figure out a way forward—which will undoubtedly involve some compromise by both of you. Your daughter moving out does seem to go beyond the typical adolescent need to assert independence, so it might be that something else is going on that is contributing to her decision. For that reason, I strongly suggest you have the conversation with your daughter (and husband) in a family counseling session. Of course, you'll have to reach out to your daughter to make that happen. Hopefully, emphasizing that the point of counseling is not to convince her to move back home but rather to figure out how to make your relationship work, particularly now that she's a young adult and needs more independence, will make her willing to try family counseling.

My 17-year-old daughter never wants to spend time with her family. She joined a group of friends during her senior year of high school and is always doing activities with them and sometimes with their families (camping trips, yoga classes, etc.). During the year that she has known them, she has never brought any of these friends over to our home so we could meet them and insists on socializing at their homes. I have told her that they are welcome to hang out at our place as well whenever they like and that we would like to meet them, but she refuses to do so. My daughter thinks we are too strict because she has a curfew, require her to tell us where she is and with whom she will be, and because we are not as "cool" as other parents who allow kids to drink at their home. I have no reason to suspect that these kids are a negative influence, and my daughter seems happy, but I am feeling hurt and confused that my daughter has shut us out of her life. When she is home, she stays in her room and on her phone. She is a good student, works part-time, is responsible about doing chores, and will be heading off to college in a few months. I know she needs to be independent of us, and we are trying to give her her space. But I feel hurt and jealous that she prefers to do activities with her friends and their families instead of ours, especially in the last remaining months before she goes away to college. Should I be asking that she spend time with us as well as her friends? Should I try to restrict how much time she spends with them? Since she got out of school, she goes over to their homes or goes out with them at least five days per week, comes home at midnight and has weekly sleepovers at their homes. Does "letting go" mean having almost no relationship with your child? I feel like she is merely using our home as a place to sleep and eat. What have I done wrong that she doesn't want to spend time with us?

Dear Sadie,
</span><p>
Understandably, you feel hurt by your daughter choosing to spend time with her friends instead of with you, but you also shouldn't take it too personally. As you pointed out, you're considered the strict parents among her friend group, so, naturally, her friends prefer to hang out someplace that seems to have fewer rules. Also, your daughter knows that you'll always be an essential part of her life, but friendships can be more fickle, so she's probably focused on spending as much time with her friends as possible before they go to college in different places. 
</p><p>
That being said, it's entirely appropriate to ask your daughter to spend more time with your family. But don't make it about your family versus her friends by restricting her time with her friends. You can be open with your daughter and tell her that you want to spend some quality time with her as a family before she goes off to college since this might be the last time she's living at home. I'd suggest having her pick one day or night each week that you do something together as a family, and then get her ideas for what you should do. If you do things that she's interested in, that will help her want to spend time with your family. And if you can, a family vacation (or staycation if that's more feasible), even if it's just for a weekend, is another way to bond before your daughter goes off to school.

My son's girlfriend came to live with us when she was pregnant with his child. Since she had a child from a previous relationship, we gave them the large upstairs bedroom. It easily holds a queen bed, twin bed, dresser, and love seat. I asked her to help once a week with cleaning the kitchen and dining room where we all eat. And I do it once a week as well. 
</p><p>
She moved in with a microwave and toaster oven and has our mini-fridge in their room. The problem is that she stays up there with her boy all day. My son works close, so sometimes comes home for lunch, and she comes downstairs then. The only time her child goes outdoors is after 6 pm when my son returns from work. I think this is wrong but not criminal. We have meetings every couple of weeks, but she will not talk. We have had no blowups, and she has no problem with us watching her son so they can go out. I have insisted that we have some toys as the boy is 2. My son agrees it is wrong but is trying to keep the peace, and though the child is not his son, he is the only male figure the child knows. They started dating when she was pregnant with her first child. What can I do, and is it criminal?

Dear GMA,
</span><p>
The critical question to ask is not whether your son's girlfriend is acting criminally, but rather whether she is doing what is best for her child. Since she is pregnant with your son's child, he can take a more active role in your household. Encourage him to make suggestions to his girlfriend, emphasizing actions that protect and enhance the physical and emotional health of her child. Both you and your son should take the stance of cooperating with his girlfriend rather than attacking her or finding fault with her behaviors. In terms of your concern that the little boy doesn't spend much time outside, volunteer to take her son to a nearby park and invite her to join you. In terms of cleaning common areas of the house, suggest that the two of you do that together. Make this chore more pleasant by playing music and perhaps having coffee/tea together afterward. What I am suggesting is taking a more positive approach to the situation, helping the girlfriend to feel like a part of the family.

My daughter is 17, soon to be 18. She has had a boyfriend for about a year now, a senior at the same high school who is 19. My daughter adores him, and he has made her super happy. I think he is a good kid too. My issue is that my daughter has driven him to school every day this whole year, which is out of her way, and she drives anywhere else they go. The other issue is that he has her pay for everything, snacks after school, movies, purchases at stores or the mall, items for him, etc. He has a job and makes quite a bit of money for his age, and he also has a car. I don't understand why he is like this since he is kind and super sweet, and seems to like my daughter. 
</p><p>
I am also concerned about another issue. This young man has never specifically asked her to be his girlfriend (he said he thinks that's dumb—and when you know, you know). Also, he does not act like a "boyfriend." He doesn't like hand-holding, my daughter said they have never kissed, and he only occasionally hugs her. I'm okay with limited affection at this age, but it seems odd to me that he isn't interested in these things. The only logic I can understand is the fact that my daughter is still a minor. He has mentioned this—but hand-holding and mild contact is not illegal. I have never known of a teenage boy to be so distant in these areas when the two of them say they are a couple. I also know that my daughter wishes he would act more like a boyfriend, not just like friends. 
</p><p>
Again, I like him, and my daughter accepts him as he is and cares for him. I let things be as they are, as my daughter is happy, but I think it does bother her and she pretends it doesn't. Any ideas as to why he might do what he does and if this is all normal?

Dear Leighanne,
</span><p>
If your daughter, who's almost 18, is okay with the relationship the way it is, then you may not want to press the issue. On the other hand, as her mother, you want to protect her from as much emotional pain as possible. There are many possible reasons for his lack of affection, including religious or cultural beliefs, sexual orientation, family values, or bad experiences in the past. Your daughter needs you to be a sounding board, someone who allows her to make her own decisions and mistakes but is also there to provide comfort and understanding and even ask questions to help her examine her life choices. 
</p><p>
The lack of physical affection is only one of the issues in their relationship. Why is your daughter doing all the driving and making all the purchases? Will he be responsible for his future educational costs and saving his money for those expenses? There are a lot of unanswered questions, but your daughter is the one who has to ask them, and then decide what to do when she learns what those answers are.

My 18-year-old is back with her boyfriend. They have been together for nine months, and he has broken up with her several times in the last couple of months over silly things. But now they seem happy. The problem I have is that my husband won't forgive her boyfriend and doesn't let him in our house. I think this is unfair even though I know he is only doing it because he loves her and doesn't want her hurt again. How do I intervene to get things back to how they were before all the break-ups?

Dear Jayne,
</span><p>
It's all about trust and communication. Understandably, your husband wants to protect your daughter, and he doesn't trust her boyfriend not to hurt her again, given his past actions. Her boyfriend needs to earn back your husband's trust—the way he's gained back your daughter's confidence, and possibly yours. The problem is that your husband isn't giving him a chance to do that. Your husband's attitude may be well-and-good if he's confident that the relationship will end yet again. However, that's not a healthy way to strengthen his relationship with your daughter. Besides, if there's even a slight possibility that they have a future together, your husband needs to reflect on how his actions now will influence his future relationship with them. 
</p><p>
Even if your husband thinks the relationship won't last, there are better ways to make his views known than effectively pretending that your daughter doesn't have a boyfriend. I suggest that you talk with your husband about how his actions may cause your daughter to feel that he does not believe in her ability to make important decisions about her life, and encourage him to discuss his concerns more frankly with her. Taking the time to talk to your daughter about her relationship, and these concerns would certainly be a start in clarifying matters. He should also speak to her boyfriend—being upfront about why he's worried and examining whether there are credible and convincing reasons as to why he deserves another chance. If even after all that, your husband still feels strongly against the boyfriend, at least he'll have made an effort to change the situation. And this will go much further towards maintaining his relationship with your daughter, the person he's trying to protect in the first place.

Hello, My daughter is almost 19 and has been dating a 19-year-old boy off and on for nearly a year. She's a first-year in college, and this has been a year filled with misery for her. She went to an out-of-state school, anticipating that her boyfriend would be true. However, she found out that he was cheating and lying, and it seems like the entire relationship was false. When she broke up with him, he begged her to come back by convincing her she is the one and only girl he loves. I'm sad to say, she got back with him, and only a few weeks later, we heard that he's been prancing around with other girls again. I'm so disappointed that she would even be interested in a guy like this. She seems to have low standards about what a relationship should be. I'm scared that he's using her for sex because I think he manipulated her to get her back into his life. I'm sad, mad, confused, and I don't want my daughter with him. HELP!!!!

Dear Stressed,
</span><p>
Have you tried talking to your daughter about your concerns? She may have no interest in hearing them or may dismiss them as unwarranted, but you won't know until you try. Reassure her that you're not trying to judge her or control her life, but you are concerned about how her boyfriend is treating her.
</p><p>
Be careful how you speak of her boyfriend, or the conversation could instead drive a wedge between you and your daughter. Focusing on him as a problem may make your daughter defensive and cause her to double down on her decision to date him. Moreover, if she does love him, he could become part of the family one day, and your criticism of him early in their relationship could damage family dynamics later on.
</p><p>
Ultimately, it's important to recognize that your daughter is an adult and it's her decision whom she wants to date—and even if it's a mistake, it's her mistake to make. But you can and should be there to support and help her.
</p><p>
One caveat: this all assumes that you don't like this guy for your daughter but that he's not doing anything to put her in danger. If he is, more straightforward and significant intervention is warranted, and there are various specialized resources that you can seek out to help in that process.

They may be moving too fast for you, but evidently, your son, his girlfriend, his girlfriend's parents, and your son's father are fine with the pace of the relationship. Think about what is at the heart of your concerns. Could it be that you are anxious that the girlfriend and her family are replacing you in some way? If you're uneasy about how responsible her parents are, then make some efforts to get to know them better. Invite them to your house for dinner or meet them for a coffee date. Let them know that since their daughter is a significant part of your son's life and your son spends so much time with her and them, you want to get better acquainted. You and her parents can become allies and look out for the welfare of your children, and there's no downside to that.</p>

My 17-year-old daughter has been very stressed about her future lately. She's graduating soon, but all she feels is dread. I want to help her, but I have no idea how to talk with her about some of her worries. For example, she was sobbing and said "It sucks that I'll "just" be another pawn in the capitalist system. Am I even "my-own-person?" Why am I here? What's the meaning?" How do I answer that? Is this an existential crisis? She says all sorts of complicated things. Last week she was sitting in the shower for hours. I knocked on the door and asked what was wrong, and she said "I don't know who I am. I don't know why I'm here. I don't understand.” I don't understand why she's saying these things. They scare me, to be honest. She won't go to therapy. She claims it has no purpose because she already knows what's wrong with her, but that she has no idea of how to fix it.

Dear Claire,

Your daughter sounds depressed and anxious, perhaps more than is typical for someone her age. Even though she claims therapy has no purpose, she does need professional help. She might be more inclined to go if she doesn't feel that all the attention will be on her. Investigate resources in your community that provide family counseling. 

Since feelings are often contagious, consider whether your daughter has been hanging out with people who might be strengthening her negative emotional state. Encourage her to spend time with people who could be more positive influences. And help her to get involved in community service so that she can see how her actions can and do make a difference in the world.

I am asking about my 18-year-old daughter. We have a strict rule in our household that she is not allowed to have boys over to the house when neither of her parents is home. However, I recently came home earlier than I was supposed to and my daughter had a boy over who she attempted to hide from me. This incident has broken my trust, and I am furious at her for doing so. But I have to mention, apart from this incident we have never had any issues of such a magnitude. I am writing to you because my husband and I are perplexed as to how to deal with this and how we should talk to her.

Dear Priyanka,
</span><p>
Your daughter disobeyed an important family rule, but that error in judgment should not destroy the positive relationship you have created. It's understandable that you're angry with your daughter, and your daughter is probably embarrassed by her actions. Since you're the parent, put aside your anger and tell your daughter you want to have an open and honest discussion with her. Listen to her side and ask for her suggestions about how to move forward and re-establish trust. Also, ask your daughter to listen as you explain how you felt about her violating your trust. If you are both willing to be open, you may be able to find a compromise. For example, perhaps your daughter can have a boy over at the house when you and your husband are not around as long as they're doing something “innocent,” such as cooking or studying together. Remember that part of your job as a parent is preparing your child to become independent and learn how to make good decisions as she grows up. Only experience will help her do that.</p>

My daughter is an 18-year-old college freshman. She did great in school before now; however, she did not do well in her first semester as a freshman. Her grades dropped very, and she barely made a 3.0 when she was a 4.0 student. We caught her vaping and confronted her, and she admitted to using drugs occasionally when she hangs out with our neighbor's daughter who is a junior at the same college. We sent our daughter to therapy, but it didn't help her much. She has a boyfriend and hangs out with him very often. She refused to bring her boyfriend home and told us she needs time. Is this an okay behavior?  My husband and I have advised her a lot and reiterated how important academics are for a good future and how vaping, alcohol and drugs are harmful. She knows they are wrong but still occasionally indulges in it. How concerned should I be and what more can I do? Please advise me.

Dear AK,
</span><p>
Your daughter's experience is very typical of those going through their first year of college. It's a time of experimentation, but that does not mean you are no longer a parent with responsibilities. While you can understand that your daughter is trying new things and wanting to be completely independent, you should still talk to her about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse and the importance of academic success for her future. You can also encourage her to find friends based on her interests (whether it's a sport or community service) rather than on a shared interest in experimenting with drugs. In terms of her grades being lower than her high school average and her actual ability, that is also pretty common. Beginning college students must figure out what they need to do differently in college as compared to high school (and without a parent pushing them). Don't make a big deal about meeting her boyfriend, but from time to time, casually invite them to a lunch or dinner. This transition is a new stage of life for you and your daughter. It will take some time and regular ongoing communication to navigate the ups and downs together.

My 16-year-old daughter just broke up with her boyfriend with whom she got along really well. He was devoted to her. She said that she wants to focus more on her studies and her friends. He was devastated of course, and when he asked her several times if they would ever get back together, she said, “never.” She then proceeded to block him on every social media app they used. We, as parents, feel she her actions are very harsh and extreme. What do you think?

Dear Lilo,

As is always the case, it's hard to make an accurate judgment without having all the facts, and as parents of a teenager, it's possible that there's more to what's going on than you know. That additional background (if there is any) may warrant the more substantial measures your daughter is taking. Even if the whole story is that she wants to focus on her studies and her friends and she is acting harshly, to some extent that's her mistake to make. As parents, you can, and should offer alternative perspectives to help your daughter to develop a more expansive point of view, such as considering her ex-boyfriend's feelings and her own potentially different future feelings. But so long as her behavior doesn't stray into bullying or other detrimental conduct, you are likely better served by gently prodding and encouraging her toward a more enlightened view than by critiquing her handling of the situation. Speaking as a former teenager, hearing my parents tell me what to do or what I should be doing was the surest way to make me want to do precisely the opposite—and not to do what they were suggesting—even if it was what I'd been planning to do myself!

My 17-year-old daughter is very moody. Perhaps to the point that it is something more, like bipolar—I'm not sure, but I don't know what to do. One second she's on top of the world, her room is spotless, she's singing everywhere she goes, and the next minute she's in her room crying and wishing she weren't alive. We took her to some therapists. One claimed that this was all for attention; another said it's just "teenage hormones." She's clearly going through something, and I think it's beyond attention-getting or “teenage hormones.” She can't hold stable relationships, she can't save money, she's always either wired or exhausted—no in between—and it seems like I'm talking to different people every time we talk. She has abused alcohol, drugs, and medications as well. My friends say I shouldn't worry too much as her grades are nearly perfect, so she can't be doing that bad. I disagree. But it seems like no one will listen to me. She's experienced her fair share of trauma, and I'm sure that PTSD may be a contributing factor. However, this has flared up in the past six months, and I'm not sure why. She refuses to talk to me about it, claiming that I have better things to do than listen to her. One of her friends recently dropped by when he knew she wouldn't be home and told me that she's been sneaking out and going to parties. What should I do?

Dear Blake,

It sounds extraordinarily frustrating that everyone tells you that you are overreacting, but your daughter's emotional mood-swings seem outside the range of “normal” adolescent moodiness. I suspect there are multiple factors involved in these mood swings, including physiological, environmental, personal history and conceivably, her drug-taking. The most important thing for you to do is to find an agency or professional who will take your concerns and her behaviors seriously. Customary treatment will include a full psychological and medical evaluation and a conference with both of you about the diagnosis and options going forward. Parents know their children. Just because she is a good student doesn't mean she isn't suffering. And the fact that her friend came to you with a point that confirmed your fears should give you further confidence. Don't give up until you find the right place that will diagnose and treat her properly.

Dear Didi,
</span><p>
Your situation is particularly tricky since it's not just your son's relationship that is in the picture, but your relationship with his girlfriend's mom. Your son probably considers himself to be an adult and doesn't see the need for his girlfriend's family to check up on him. I understand why he doesn't want his girlfriend's family to see what he posts on social media since they may not approve of all of his activities. However, his reluctance to grant them access is arousing their suspicions and adding further complexity in this age of media-connected lives.  
</p><p>
Have a conversation with your son about whether he is concerned that the family will judge him for what's in his social media accounts. Ask him to consider whether his lifestyle and romantic choices are aligned. Beyond the personal question, use this opportunity to ensure that your son is aware of the relationship of social media to future employment and educational endeavors. Explain that he should consider whether anything he posts could be misinterpreted or create a negative impression. Once published, a photo becomes an almost-permanent part of an individual's history and years later can become problematic. A youthful indiscretion can result in losing a job or failing a background check, something we see in the news frequently.

I have a 19-year-old daughter who I love, but I want her to become more independent. At her age, I had a job, my own car, car insurance, was a full-time college student but lived with my parents. During high school, my daughter was brilliant, though timid, and not part of the “in-crowd.”  She had bouts of anxiety and depression for which we provided sessions of therapy. I don't think she gained much out of those sessions as we observed minimal change and we felt she didn't make an effort to “open up” to make real change. She is on medication, but we constantly need to remind her to take it. She didn't seem excited for college beyond the desire to make new relationships and connections. She chose a local college, and we supported it with the suggestion of living on campus so she could learn about becoming independent. However, it seems that this suggestion has made her more stressed and caused her unhappiness. She has no drive to look for a job. She takes my wife's car whenever possible and gets upset with us when we don't let her have it. She sleeps most of the day when home from school and doesn't do any chores for herself or us, such as putting dishes away or cleaning up her room. I make statements to her that she needs to be more independent since she is 19 and technically an adult, but my daughter gets defensive, and my wife yells at me saying that I am “berating our daughter,” which leads to us being upset with each other. My wife is not in agreement with me that our daughter needs to act her age and my daughter is fueled by this thinking. Don't get me wrong, my daughter is kind and caring to others, just not to her parents when things don't go her way, or we ask her to do something. I feel like she should be doing so much more at her age but am I expecting too much?  My wife disagrees with me that our daughter needs to learn things like how to apply for a job, interact as an adult, reply to emails about job applications promptly, monitor her student loan and grades monthly, and so on. Am I just an old school dad who should not expect her to be at the same level of maturity as I was?  Am I wrong to disagree with supporting her current ways and should I just keep quiet and let things get to an all-time low before I intervene?  What should I do?

Dear Old School Dad,
</span><p>
As a start, it's important to recognize a couple of things. First, you may be partly right and partly wrong at the same time. Second, even if you're 100% reasonable in your expectations, you may still need to adjust how you communicate them and how you assist your daughter in realizing her goals. Underlying both of these points is the fact that there may be various reasons why your daughter is not as independent as you think she should be. Some may be specific to her. She may be depressed, unmotivated, dealing with other issues that she hasn't communicated to you, she may merely be acting defiant, or something else entirely. Others may be external. For better or worse, teenagers today are living in very different circumstances than teenagers from other generations. And some have to do with where your expectations are coming from, like whether you want her to be more independent because you want an empty nest, or because you think women her age should be more independent, or because you think has the potential to be more independent, and you want her to realize that potential. Depending on what your reasons are, some may make your expectations more justifiable, and others less so. Similarly, even if your expectations are right on the mark, your daughter (and your wife) may not understand the reasons behind them, which can result in disagreement.
</p><p>
It will be helpful to discuss and clarify your perspective with your wife so that you are both on the same page—or at least understand better where you're not. She may have ideas about how to communicate with your daughter in a different way that might be more effective. Ultimately, it's not inherently wrong to support your daughter or push her under the right circumstances. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, but seeking a more open dialogue may unlock pathways to compromise and understanding that will benefit everyone.

My 17-year-old, Kylee is a smart, funny, and talented girl. She's a good kid, but I'm worried about her. She's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for years now, and I feel like I'm starting to see just how severe it is. Back when she was 12 to 16, I told her that she had no reason to be depressed, that others have it worse, that she's ungrateful, etc., and I regret that. I've recently been reading her blog, and her entries have brought me to tears. She's written about environmental destruction, the planet dying, war, hopelessness, childhood trauma, pollution, abusive relationships, poverty, misery, bullying, crime, etc. She's very insightful and intelligent, but one of her lines in an entry stuck out to me. "I'd rather be the biggest idiot on the planet, blissfully ignorant, and happy, rather than intelligent, aware, and miserable like I am now.” She doesn't know that I know about her blog. I saw it when I found her asleep at her desk in the middle of an entry, and I'm not sure how to bring it up or if I even should. 
</p><p>
She's been through more than her fair share of hurt, and I feel like I never took any of that into account until I read just how much her depression and anxiety has skyrocketed. I'm noticing little things now that I never saw before—how she stares at the bulldozed land across from our house that used to be woods and animals, or looks up at the sky at night and frowns when she can't see stars. I'm noticing that she's more withdrawn from her friends and how she doesn't seem to want any relationship at all. And I'm noticing just how much of her time she dedicates to fictional worlds. 
</p><p>
I feel terrible for not noticing these things sooner. I assumed my daughter was just being a moody teenager, but I feel like it's beyond that now. I love my daughter, and I'm scared. She feels like there's no future to look forward to. Another line on her blog shook me. "For anyone who's worried, I'm not going to hurt myself. I don't want to die, but I feel like there's no other escape. There's no escaping the despair and destruction that humanity has brought upon themselves. A happy life seems like nothing but a fantasy.” What should I do?

Dear Sara,
</span><p>
At this point, your daughter needs professional help since she might be suicidal. Her expressions of hopelessness and withdrawal from friends are warning signs. Start by going to the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/contact-the-lifeline/" target="_blank">suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a> or you may call at <a href="tel:1-800-273-8255"><img src="images/phone.png" alt="phone icon" longdesc="images/phone.png"> 800-273-8255</a>, or text a message to <a href="sms:741741"><img src="images/text.png" alt="message icon" longdesc="images/text.png"> 741741</a>. They should be able to help you locate resources in your community that specialize in working with adolescents in crisis. 
</p><p>
You can't go back in time to change things nor will it help to blame yourself for not recognizing how deeply depressed your daughter had become or that what she was experiencing was more than typical teenage moodiness. The important thing now is to make sure your daughter gets the medical and psychological help she needs to begin to lead a more hopeful life. She would probably benefit from a combination of drugs, psychotherapy, and involvement in community service that address some of the issues she cares deeply about. And, of course, she needs continuing support from you and other family members and friends.

Dear Sarah,

First, try to separate what you experienced in your past relationship with your daughter's father from your feelings about your daughter's relationship with her current boyfriend. Then you can try to support her with an open mind. If your daughter really doesn't mind being excluded from events that her boyfriend has been invited to, then leave it alone. But since you wrote about the boyfriend getting angry at your daughter's questions, and her upset when discussing the situation with you, it seems that your daughter is troubled by aspects of her relationship. I don't think you should talk to the boyfriend since that could well anger the boyfriend and make the situation even worse. Instead, let your daughter know that you are available to listen or to give advice, whichever she wants or needs. And let her know, in as gentle and nonjudgmental a way as possible, that you are concerned about her because her boyfriend doesn't seem to be acting respectfully towards her. Then it's up to her to decide what her next steps are.

My daughter, Bailey, is 17-years-old and has a lot of problems. Her worst ones are probably her anxiety, ADHD, and eating disorder, but I'm just focusing on the eating disorder in this question. I'm honestly confused. I tell her that she looks good and that she isn't fat, and she'll say, “I know I'm not fat.” So, I'll ask her why she won't eat, and she'll get defensive. She's been through sexual abuse, and I feel like that may contribute to what she's going through. I overheard her on the phone with her girlfriend, and she said, “I never want to look like I looked when I was with him.” Him being a boy who sexually abused her. Her girlfriend, Racheal, is very kind and supportive and I'm glad that she has someone like her, but I know that Racheal can't help her. Not fully at least. I feel useless in this situation. My daughter never comes to me about anything. I didn't know about two year-long physical and emotional abuse, or the year-long sexual abuse that boy put her through until a year after it was all over. She refuses to go to therapy because she thinks it's a waste of money. We're tight on funds right now, so I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss.

Dear Selene,
</span><p>
Perhaps your daughter Bailey is telling you that therapy is a waste of money because she is sensitive to your family's difficult financial situation and doesn't want to increase your burden. You might want to investigate low-cost or even free therapy options in your community. If you have health coverage, find out what kind of mental health treatment is available. 
</p><p>
Because Bailey connects her body size with the abuse she suffered, she needs to find a way to change that association. From what she has told her friend Racheal, it is evident that your daughter understands the connection intellectually, but that is very different from dealing with the issue on an emotional level. To deal with that deep emotional and physical pain requires professional help. And since your daughter is dealing with not just an eating disorder but other challenges as well, such as general anxiety and ADHD, she needs more support than either you or Racheal can provide to her.

My 17-year-old daughter is quite smart, kind, beautiful, loving, and generous. She has a big heart, and I'm grateful for that, but I'm also concerned. I got a call from the counselor at her school calling my attention to something she has been doing. He told me that she's been buying other kids lunch, which would not be a problem on its own, but then she ends up having no money to buy herself any. He expressed that this happens daily. He also said that she's tried to take the blame for things other students have done. This has landed her in trouble multiple times. For instance, she could have been suspended for taking responsibility for a pack of cigarettes that a boy dropped out of his pocket, however, the boy spoke up and took responsibility himself for his actions. She told me that she lost her winter coat, but it turns out she gave it to a girl at school who couldn't afford one. The counselor also told me that he observed her spending $40 on ice cream for schoolmates she doesn't even know. 
</p><p>
I love my daughter, and I'm happy that she has such a giving nature, but I'm afraid that people manipulate her. The other day she was crying in her room because a boy called her selfish when she didn't want to send him inappropriate pictures. Being selfish is her worst nightmare, so it really hit that nerve. She's been abused, walked all over, and treated like garbage, but she's convinced that it's because she's a selfish and terrible person. I'm at a loss on what to do. I'm scared that her generosity and kindness will get her hurt yet again.

Dear Leslie,
</span><p>
I understand your concern since your daughter's overly generous and kind behavior is getting her into trouble and causing her to lie. The counselor was right to contact you since the two of you need to figure out why she has such an intense need to help others that she's actually hurting herself. On top of that, she has an inaccurate picture of herself as a selfish person, when the opposite is true. The school counselor called you to make sure you were aware of the situation, and now you need to call him to figure out how best to help your daughter. Can he provide the kind of counseling that she needs or can he refer you to another professional who can work with you and your daughter to get to the bottom of her extreme behavior? She may feel that people will like her only if she buys things for them or takes the blame for their misdeeds. If that is how she feels, she needs to recognize that misperception and then learn healthier ways to fit in or be liked. And she needs to learn to take care of herself without losing that compassionate part of who she is.

It's hard watching all the drama surrounding your daughter and her first boyfriend, and it will continue to be tough to deal with the drama that will come with a second or maybe even a third boyfriend. My advice is to be supportive and help her think about what she wants. If you come down firmly on one side, then you become the bearer of those feelings and not your daughter.  She is the one who must ultimately make the decisions about her dating life. Much as we would like to, we cannot protect our children from hurt. Keep in mind that heartbreak is not all negative since it teaches resilience and that pain is part of love and life.

My 17-year-old son is an excellent student. He's a junior and gets all A's in school. School comes easily for him, so he does not have to work very hard for those A's. He also has a part-time job on the weekends and plays travel soccer. I have a lot to be thankful for. At the same time, we have caught him smoking marijuana and drinking on several occasions. This seems to be common among the friends he hangs out with and even condoned by their parents.  My husband and I have had a zero tolerance policy as far as drugs and alcohol usage for our children and when we have caught our son using we have grounded him and attempted to talk through why he's doing it and why we don't want him to. What we are experiencing now is a lot of anger about his situation. He is just about to come off of six weeks of being at home on weekends other than work and is really angry when we try to talk about what happened to initiate this grounding. We have wanted to see a counselor as a family as well as individually, but scheduling is often a problem, and he can't seem to get past his anger at us. My question is: are we overreacting to him using alcohol and drugs and is there anything more that we should be doing?

Dear Sandie,
</span><p>
When you've tried talking and grounding him, but his behavior hasn't changed, it's time for another tactic. You say that the other parents condone this behavior, but have you talked to them or just taken your son's word for that? When parents get together and figure out a plan, that can be more effective than one family setting rules. In addition to talking to other parents, you and your husband might focus on making rules that your son can realistically keep, such as never driving after drinking or smoking marijuana and not letting their friends drive who have been doing so. You should continue to reinforce and talk your family's values, but you need to find other ways to influence your son. Although scheduling counseling has been difficult, make it happen because it's a priority. That presents a message to your son that you consider this situation a serious one and you're going to do whatever it takes to offer him help.
</p><p>
A final thing to keep in mind is that being overly strict may backfire since he is going off to college soon, and you want him to be prepared to make intelligent decisions when you're not around. Continue to remind your son that you are concerned about his health and safety, and that's your job as a parent.

My 22-year-old daughter is my life. We were so close when she was growing up. I divorced her father after 18 years of marriage. He is a bad alcoholic and was not intimate with me for 12 years. But I went about it the wrong way. I fell in love with another man who I married. My ex and I are still friends. Though I wish I had done things differently now it's too late. My husband does everything for both of my daughters—he loves them like they were his own. He has no children. He has put both of my girls through college. My oldest is my saving grace—has a great job, just a great kid. My youngest, 22, will not respond to me at all. When I try to go to NYC to see her she treats me like she hates me. I love her so much. I can't have a happy life until I get my baby back. My husband sends us to Florida every April and I can't do this anymore. I have an anxiety disorder and a month before we go I start getting so nervous. I adore her so much, she is and always will be my baby. I feel like when she graduates I will never see her again. This is tearing my heart apart. I live and breathe this. I am so sad. She has never texted me first or called me since she left for school. I'm not sure what I have done to make her despise me. I love her so much and she knows it. Can you please tell me what you think I should do? Now I don't bother her, and soon she will be home for vacation and I'm sure she will be back to just staying in her room and going to work, which she does on vacation. When she comes out of her room she glares at me like she hates me. My anxiety is through the roof. Please give me some advice! Thank you so much!!!

Dear Susan,
</span><p>
You are dealing with a couple of different issues, and both need attention. First, you say that you have an anxiety disorder, which makes every situation more challenging. I don't know whether you have sought help for that condition, which would probably involve some combination of medication and psychotherapy. If you are not getting treatment, that should be a priority. Once you start feeling more in control of your own life, it will be easier to deal with your other significant issue, which is your relationship with your 22 year-old daughter. From how you describe her in your letter, she is your “baby.” It may be that your daughter is trying to live an independent, adult life, and you are continuing to treat her as a child. She may be resentful about what happened between you and her father and blames you for the loss of her family, not really understanding the full situation. Hard as it might be for you, allow her the separation she craves, and then gradually make an effort to invite her to talk to you and perhaps do something that both of you would enjoy. If she has a good relationship with her older sister, you could include both of them in an activity. The more patient and supportive you are, the greater the odds are for reestablishing a close relationship with your younger daughter.

My daughter is 25 years old and lives in the same large city as I do. She and I get along well and enjoy each other's company. But she does not invite me to do things with her, such as shopping, movies, etc. I have invited her to do things with me with some success. My problem is she has a close friend my age (50). She spends many weekends hanging out with this 50 year old doing things, from parties and concerts to just hanging out. I've tried to not feel wrong/angry/jealous towards this relationship but it is hard for me. I feel my daughter has no interest in being with me, but has no problem being with someone else my age. This friend has younger children (8 and 6, both boys). It is especially hard when my daughter talks about the things she has done with her friend. I feel like they are having the mother/daughter relationship I should be having with her. How do I talk to my daughter about this? Or is it something I should just keep to myself and try to accept?

Dear Dana B,
</span><p>
I can understand why you are hurt by the close friendship your daughter has with a woman who is about your age. The way you see it, they are behaving more like a mother/daughter pair than friends. But think about what they do together—going to parties, movies, and concerts together—just the kinds of activities people do with their friends. The questions to ask yourself are: Does she confide in you when she has problems? Does she come to you when she needs another point of view before making a decision?  You've already noted that you get along well and enjoy each other's company, so perhaps the problem is more about your perception than it is about the reality. It is natural for a 25 year-old to take her mother a bit for granted—you've always been there for her, and she expects that you will continue to do so. Her friend, on the other hand, has a novel perspective to share and has young children, which might make her more interesting right now. 
</p><p>
Since you have had some success when you invite your daughter to join you in an activity, continue to reach out to her. And, hard as it may be, don't talk to your daughter about your jealousy since the result of that conversation might be that she will avoid telling you about her life, creating more of a barrier to your relationship with her. One other idea for you to try is to invite your daughter and her friend to do something with you or suggest gently that you'd be interested in joining them on one of their activities. But be sure not to push too hard or expect to join them all the time.

I just learned that my son's best friend (for 6 years) took my daughter's virginity and then dropped her. I'm angry and upset and of course want to help my daughter. My initial reaction is to forbid this boy from coming to our house any more. This is not because I think it will happen again, but because I feel that my 16 year old daughter shouldn't have to be subjected to seeing him. I also feel that my son should be furious with his friend. But, I do know that with teenagers it is often wise for parents to let them figure things out themselves. Should I tell my son his friend can't visit any more, or should I stay out of it?

Hi Cez,
</span><p>
You are wise to consider whether it is better to let your teenage kids figure this out for themselves or to intervene yourself. You should examine your own reaction to this situation, which you describe as a guy who “took away” your “daughter's virginity.” Was she a willing partner who later felt betrayed when he quickly dropped her? If the sex was consensual, that is a very different situation from one in which she was coerced or forced. And do you know the facts about the break-up? Did he simply disappear or did he explain his decision? The answers are critical to the actions you take. Have you already spoken to your daughter and, separately, to your son to really understand their perspectives and what they think is best? I would expect your daughter would be upset, and would much prefer not to see this fellow in her own home, a place where she should feel safe and comfortable. I am guessing that your daughter is in the process of learning some tough lessons about emotions, sexual behavior, and relationships. Make sure that your daughter knows that she has access to a therapist as the whole experience  could be traumatic for her. Sometimes, it is easier to discuss the most intimate pains with an objective therapist experienced in working with teenagers.
</p><p>
Have you spoken to your son to figure out if and why he wants to remain best friends with this guy, and whether he still wants to bring him to your home? Depending on the specific circumstances, he may be furious with his friend's behavior and the mistreatment of his sister and want to end the friendship. On the other hand, he might decide he wants to remain friends, and you cannot dictate that decision and expect him to listen. It is clear from your question that you want to raise responsible young adults. Your son has not done anything wrong, however, this difficult circumstance provides an opportunity for him to understand at a deeper level the right way to treat women.

My daughter is 18 years old, I just found out she is on birth control. She has been with her boyfriend for 1 year (he's the same age as her). When I found out I made a big drama. I told her she shouldn't be having sex, and she calmly told me she was 18 and she was being safe about it. She sometime asks me for permission to go to his house but I don't feel comfortable letting her go. I'm sure if I say no they're going to find a way either way so I don't know how to handle this situation. Should I say no? Help please.

Dear Scared Mom,
</span><p>
It sounds like you overreacted, which is understandable, but that doesn't mean that is the end of the situation. You are right that, with or without your permission, your daughter will find a way to spend time with her boyfriend. If you want to continue to influence your daughter's decisions and actions, be open to the choices and mistakes she will make. I would suggest that you initiate a conversation with your daughter explaining why you reacted the way you did and that you hope to have an honest relationship with her going forward. Your daughter's maturity is shown by her calm demeanor when you were dramatic and by her telling you that she is practicing safe sex. Make sure you let her know that you noticed and appreciate her sense or responsibility.
